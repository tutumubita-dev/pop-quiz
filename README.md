# Pop Quiz

Hope you're ready for a JavaScript pop quiz! There's a catch: you have to build it!

## Instructions

1.  Create and connect an `index.js` file to `index.html`.
2.  Create a `score` variable to keep track of how many questions the user answers correctly.
3.  Prompt the user to answer at least 3 multiple choice questions.
    1. Each question should have at least 2 choices.
    2. Validate the user's input each time.
    3. Update the `score` if the user answers correctly.
4.  After the quiz, show the user a different message depending on their performance.
    There should be distinct messages for at least these scenarios:
    1. The user answered 0 questions correctly.
    2. The user answered all questions correctly.
    3. The user answered some questions correctly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can be creative with what the questions and answers actually are!
> We're more concerned with your ability to write conditionals.
